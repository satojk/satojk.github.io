    <article class="post-content">
        <p>I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford with a focus
        in Machine Learning, although I am currently thinking of human learning
        instead, at the <a href=https://web.stanford.edu/group/pdplab/>Parallel 
        Distributed Processing (PDP) Lab</a>.  Prior to this, I used to work on 
        Natural Language Understanding at the <a 
        href=https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/>Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab 
        (OVAL)</a>, and before that, I did a little bit of Software Engineering in 
        industry.</p>
        <p>My undergraduate homes are the Mathematics and Philosophy 
        departments at Stanford. You can occasionally find me at these places 
        thinking less practical thoughts.</p>
        <p>During non-pandemic years, I enjoy camping (my favorite campground 
        is Kirk Creek, in Big Sur, CA) and sharing homebrewed kombucha with 
        friends (my most successful flavor to date was honey-lime). During 
        pandemic years, I spend most of my time reading.</p>
        <p>My github is <a href=https://github.com/satojk/>@satojk</a>, and you 
        can reach me at satojk at cs.stanford.edu.</p>
