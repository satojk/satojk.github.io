      Two Proofs
    </h2>

    <article class="post-content-indent">
        <p>Suppose you are playing soccer with your friends, and you want to 
        keep track of which players are the best team players in the 
        offense. So whenever a goal is scored, you write down who the last two 
        players to touch the ball in the scoring team were. You figure that if 
        someone is a good team player in the offense, they will show up in many 
        such pairs. Specifically. a good team player should play well with a 
        variety of different people, and so you are not too interested if the 
        same pair scores one, or two, or three goals in a game. You are only 
        really interested in how many different people a given person is 
        able to score goals with. Moreover, if someone scores a goal completely 
        alone, then that doesn't count - you're interested in assessing 
        team-playing capabilities, after all.</p>

        <p>After keeping this score for a while, and ranking players by how
        many different people they have scored goals with, you begin to notice
        that you always seem to have ties somewhere in the ranking. This is
        obvious when there is only one goal in the game: each of the two
        scoring players will have scored a goal with one other person (that is,
        each other). But this shows up in more complicated patterns too: if
        Annie scores a goal with Benjamin, but Benjamin also scores a goal with
        Charlie, then Annie and Charlie are tied in second place, each with a
        single goal. Now you're curious, and you start imagining different game
        results, each more complicated than the other, trying to get a ranking
        of team players with no ties. After a while with no success, you start
        wondering whether this is impossible. It certainly seems so, but why
        would that be?</p>

        <p>Eventually, you realize something interesting. Since there are
        eleven players to each team, each player can only score goals with at 
        most ten other players. Additionally, of course, the minimum number of 
        players someone could score goals with is zero. Between zero and 
        ten, there are exactly eleven possible "scores" a player can get in the 
        team-playing ranking, and you have exactly eleven players. If you want 
        there to be no ties, you would need each of these eleven possible 
        scores to be actual scores by players. If no player has a team-playing 
        score of three, for example, then this means that two players must be 
        tied with some other score, since there will only be ten possible 
        different scores, for eleven players.</p>

        <p>So now you know what scenario you need to draw up, and you get to 
        work. But you still can't get all players to have distinct scores, and 
        soon you realize why: a player can only have a score of zero if they 
        score no goals with any other player. But a player can only have a 
        score of ten if they score goals with all other players. You can't 
        have both of these happen in the same match! If someone scored no goals 
        with anyone else, then that means the maximum score someone else could 
        have gotten is nine, not ten! Or alternatively, if Annie scored 
        goals with everyone else in the team, then everyone else must have 
        scored at least one goal with someone else - Annie, in the very 
        least - and so no one can have a score of zero! Either way, the 
        total number of possible scores is ten, not eleven. And since 
        you have eleven players, that means there must be some single 
        score which at least two players achieved.</p>
